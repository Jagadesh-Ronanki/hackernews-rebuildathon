We are building hacker news modern frontend using Next js and TypeScript and Shadcn. We already have a frontend with themed colors and responsive design we are looking for.

We have a navbar and a page which renders a list of posts. But posts are hardcoded.

Your task is to connect the frontend to the API and make it dynamic. We already have developed API tests to test out if the API is working correctly. You can use these tests to verify your implementation in folder src/api. 

I am not asking to do all the features/pages that we included in navigation bar. I want you to make sure that all available endpoints are working and you can fetch data from them.

And I already used theme to build it orange color as primary color. You can use this color in your implementation. Don't change any styles that effect the responsive design or the theme.

Try bringing modularity to your code. Use components and hooks to make it reusable and easy to maintain.
