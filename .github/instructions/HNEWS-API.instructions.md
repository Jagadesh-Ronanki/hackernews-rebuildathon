Read the [Hacker News API documentation](HNEWS.md) in the root directory of this repository to understand how to use the API.

And start writing code to interact with the Hacker News API in api folder. Build object types and functions to fetch data from the API, such as fetching top stories, user profiles, comments, etc. Basically all the endpoints listed in the API documentation.

Also I want you to write tests for the functions you create. Use the `tests` folder to write your tests. You can use any testing framework you prefer, but make sure to keep the tests organized and easy to run.

If you want an existing user use account name `susam`.
If you want to create a new user, use username `0xrj` and password `0xrj`.

Just focus on completing the API functions and tests. You can ignore the frontend part of the project for now.
